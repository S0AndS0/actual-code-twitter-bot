## 100 Days of Actual Code Twitter Bot

Source code for [@ActualCodeBot](https://twitter.com/ActualCodeBot).

**Problem**: Twitter is polluted with tweets using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag where the tweet does not actually involve a status update for a person engaged in the challenge described on [100daysofcode.com](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

**Solution**: This code will retweet #100DaysOfCode tweets, but only when a link to source code is included.

### Supported Domains

The tweet must contain a link to one of the following domains:

- github.com
- gitlab.com
- codepen.io
- codesandbox.io
- jsbin.com
- jsfiddle.net
- plnkr.co
- repl.it
- stackblitz.com
